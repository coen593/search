## CS50w assignment

My take at the CS50w Search assignment, which requires to replicate the partial front ends of Google Search, Google Image Search and (partial) Google Advanced Search. Using the search functions will redirect to Google result pages, or in case of clicking "I'm feeling lucky", directly to the web page linked in the first search result.

The site is responsive and follows the design of Google's on pages (as of 2021/06/08).
